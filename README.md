👋 Hi, I'm Marzie!

I have a background in astrophysics and a passion for combining data analysis with scientific methods to extract insights from messy, unstructured data. 

🔭 🔭 Currently, after more than three years of working as a data analyst, I take a break to upgrade my skills in Python and Machine learning while actively seeking opportunities in data science to further grow my skills in this exciting field.
 

🌱 I’m continuously honing my expertise in  Python, SQL and Power BI through hands-on projects. I’ve also completed several machine learning projects, applying algorithms to real-world data challenges.

💡 If you have an interesting project or idea related to data analytics or data science and would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me: hosmarzi94@gmail.com.
