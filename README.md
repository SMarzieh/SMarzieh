ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marzie!

I have a background in astrophysics and a passion for combining data analysis with scientific methods to extract insights from messy, unstructured data.
ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Power BI developer and data analyst at HexaBase, while actively seeking opportunities in data science to further grow my skills in this exciting field.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously honing my expertise in Power BI, Python, and SQL through hands-on projects. Iâ€™ve also completed several machine learning projects, applying algorithms to real-world data challenges.
ðŸ’¡ If you have an interesting project or idea related to data analytics or data science and would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me: hosmarzi94@gmail.com.
